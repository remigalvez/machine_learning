# Machine Learning
## Assignment I

All scripts can be run directly from their directory, as the data sets are included in the same directory.

#### Problem 1

Problem I can be found in '1_and_2.pdf'

#### Problem 2 

Problem II can be found in '1_and_2.pdf'

#### Problem 3 

All MATLab code files for problem 3 can be found in the './3' directory. 'perceptron.m' is a simple script to run the perceptron algorithm with both data sets, and with the required arguments. Running this script will generate MATLab graphs, but screenshots of these graphs also appear in 'graph_screenshots.pdf'.

#### Problem 4

All MATLab code files for problem 4 can be found in the './4' directory. 'knn.m' is a simple script to run the k-nearest neighbor algorithm several times using different arguments, as required in the problem set. Though MATLab will plot graphs after running this script, screenshots of the graphs also appear in 'graph_screenshots.pdf'.
